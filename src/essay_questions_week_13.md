1. A docker image packages all the files, dependencies, etc. needed to build the container to run an application independently of the system it will be run on. This level of abstraction ensures the application will run on any system regardless of the OS, local setup, etc.
2. A container is an abstraction that isolates all the code, dependencies, etc. necessary to run an application from the system it's being run on. A virtual machine makes use of a computer's hardware to create an isolated 'virtual computer'. For example, you allocate a percentage of your computer's CPU, RAM, and storage to create the virtual machine.
